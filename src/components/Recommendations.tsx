    content: 'I had the pleasure of working closely with Sharmeen as her Lead Engineer at Falabella India. Sharmeen is a highly skilled engineer with a strong foundation in Problem solving . Her attention to detail and analytical mindset were instrumental in stabilising the stock transfer order project especially the INBOUND flow. Sharmeen used to proactively take up issues observed in production env and solved the same without much of intervention from other team members, which significantly ensured the smooth flow of INBOUND business. Beyond technical proficiency, She is a valuable team player who readily collaborates with colleagues to overcome challenges and achieve objectives. I particularly admire Sharmeen\'s adaptability nature, which sets her apart as a standout engineer. During her internship when asked to work on a new technology and a new problem domain she was ready to take up the challenge and was quite impressive with what she delivered. I wholeheartedly recommend Sharmeen as an engineer and I am confident that she will excel where ever she goes.'
